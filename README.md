# Virtual Math Calculator 🎉

🚀 **Introducing the Virtual Math Calculator - Where AI Meets Math!** 🚀

I'm thrilled to share my latest project, the **Virtual Math Calculator**, which leverages the power of AI to solve mathematical equations through hand gestures. This innovative tool uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Google's Gemini API to provide a seamless and interactive experience.

## How It Works:
1. **Draw Your Equation** ✏️: Keep your index finger up to draw the equation on the canvas.
2. **Navigate the Canvas** 🖐️: Use two fingers up to move around the canvas.
3. **Reset/Erase** 🗑️: Raise your thumb to reset or erase the canvas.
4. **Submit for Solving** ✅: Show the gesture with only your thumb down and four fingers up (0,1,1,1,1) to submit the equation for solving.

## Key Features:
- **AI-Powered** 🤖: Utilizes the Gemini API for accurate and efficient problem-solving.
- **Interactive** 🎨: Real-time hand gesture recognition for a smooth user experience.
- **Free to Use** 💸: Accessible to everyone without any cost.
